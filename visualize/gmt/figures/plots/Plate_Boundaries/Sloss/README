If you know of any dataset that should be included (this means
the dataset should be useful to several people at the Seismo Lab),
or you know of any update to an existing data set, please let us
know.

Currently the following data sets are available:

The original BOUND.90 file came by way of Peter Sloss at NOAA/NGDC in Boulder,
Colorado, and was modified by Dr. Paul Wessel to  a multiple segment file,
(lon/lat), suitable for plotting with the -M option in psxy.   However, the
"HEADER LINE 2" was inadvertently left out of the modified "plate_boundaries"
file.   For those of you who need the information that was in "HEADER LINE 2",

        plate_boundaries.codes

combines both (HEADER LINE 1) and (the codes in HEADER LINE 2) into a
single record which begins with the multiple segment flag.

*****************************************************************************
* Information on the original BOUND.90 file follows:
*****************************************************************************
* 
* Source: Paleo-Oceanographic Mapping Project (University of Texas at Austin)
* Data Manager: Lisa Gahagan, (512) 471-0488
* 
* Each boundary has a 2 line header, followed by a string of lats, longs,
* and pen movements (2 = pen down, or connect to previous point, 3 = pen up,
* or start a new line segment).  A lat, long of 99.000, 99.000 signifies
* the end of the string for that boundary.  
* 
* HEADER LINE 1:
*         Reference number for location and source (see file ref.lis)
*         Plate boundary number
*         Name of boundary
* 
* HEADER LINE 2:
*         Reference number for plate
*         Time of appearance (mya)
*         Time of disappearance (mya)* 
*         Boundary Type Code:
*                 FZ = fracture zone
*                 RI = ridge
*                 SS = strike-slip
*                 TF = transform fault
*                 TR = trench
*                 etc. (see file ref.lis)
*         Magnetic anomaly code*
*         Plate code*
*         Color code for plotting*
*         
* * signifies these codes are inappropriate for this data set (POMP
* maintains other files of past isochrons in this format)
