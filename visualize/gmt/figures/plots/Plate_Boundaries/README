This directory contains the "generic" plate boundaries file [plate_boundaries],
which has an unknown origin (Peter Sloss?).

The directory /home/datalib/Plate_Kinematic_Models/ contains sets of plates,
along with euler vectors describing the motion of the plates.

I copied the Bird plates here [bird_boundaries].

I'm not sure where [nuvel1_boundaries] came from, although the boundaries
are not consistent with the NUVEL-1 paper (1990), which has 14 plates.

The directory /home/datalib/Seafloor_Age/plate_polygons
also contains a set of plate polygons.

Please let me know if you find additional models to include.
